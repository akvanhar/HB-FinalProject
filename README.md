Make Less Mush
A Hackbright Final Project
Make Less Mush is a web app created by Alyson van HArdenberg 
Having a baby is a full time job, and wanting to feed them a wide variety of healthy, nutritious food is a lot of work! Make Less Mush endeavors to make this job easier by providing a social-media based food sharing/messaging service. Users may log in with Facebook which will filter listings so the user can see their friends posts first. A user may alternatively view the listings on a map.

Alyson graduated from an accelerated nursing program with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. While pursuing this career, Alyson was drawn to the rapidly changing, creative aspect of the technical industry. Alyson spent time talking to software engineers, who pointed her towards Hackbright Academy. Alyson is excited to bring the skill of fast-paced problem-solving that she developed as a nurse to her software development. Developing software has given Alyson another medium in which to express her creativity. Alyson also expresses this passion for creativity in her hobbies as a potter, a knitter and a baker.
